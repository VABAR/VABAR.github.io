VIBASS2 is the second edition of the summer school on Bayesian
Statistics to be held from 16th until 20th July 2018 in València
(Spain). 
VIBASS2 offers an opportunity to be introduced into the
Bayesian reasoning without previous knowledge in the subject.

The five days of VIBASS are organised in __three parts__:

1. The first two days include a [__basic course on Bayesian learning__]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass2-intro/) (12 hours), with conceptual sessions in the morning and practical sessions with R packages in the afternoon.

	It would be advisable that participants bring their laptops for the practical sessions.

2. The [second part]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass2-course/) is dedicated to an __issue of current interest in Bayesian research__. 

	This second edition is dedicated to __Structured Additive Regression Models__ and the R package [__BayesX__](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/bayesx/550513.html).

	This [12 h course]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass2-course/) is provided by [__Nadja Klein__](https://mbs.edu/faculty/nadja-klein), Research Feodor-Lynen-Fellow (Humboldt Foundation), University of Melbourne (Australia) and [__Nikolaus Umlauf__](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~umlauf/) Assistant Professor in Statistics, Universität Innsbruck (Austria). Both are coauthors of the R package __BayesX__

	It includes two [plenary sessions]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass2-talks/), with invited speakers researchers [__Paloma Botella__]() (Conselleria de Sanitat Universal i Salut Pública. Generalitat Valenciana)and [__Luigi Spezia__]() (Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland, BioSS).
