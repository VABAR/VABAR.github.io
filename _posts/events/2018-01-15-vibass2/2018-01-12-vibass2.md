VIBASS2 is the second edition of the summer school on Bayesian
Statistics to be held from 16th until 20th July 2018 in València
(Spain). 
VIBASS2 offers an opportunity to be introduced into the
Bayesian reasoning without previous knowledge in the subject.

The five days of VIBASS are organised in __three parts__:

1. The first two days include a __basic course on Bayesian learning__ (12 hours), with conceptual sessions in the morning and practical sessions with R packages in the afternoon.

	It would be advisable that participants bring their laptops for the practical sessions.

2. The second part is dedicated to an __issue of current interest in Bayesian research__. This second edition is dedicated to __Structured Additive Regression Models__ and the R package [__BayesX__](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/bayesx/550513.html).

	This course (12 hours) is provided by [__Nadja Klein__](https://mbs.edu/faculty/nadja-klein), Research Feodor-Lynen-Fellow (Humboldt Foundation), University of Melbourne (Australia) and [__Nikolaus Umlauf__](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~umlauf/) Assistant Professor in Statistics, Universität Innsbruck (Austria). Both are coauthors of the R package __BayesX__

		[__Nadja Klein__](https://mbs.edu/faculty/nadja-klein), Feodor-Lynen-Fellow (Humboldt Foundation), University of Melbourne (Australia). Nadja pursued research in the areas of Bayesian statistics, computational methods, machine learning with a focus on developing distributional statistical and econometric methods for large and complex datasets. These can be used for modelling highly nonlinear data and to solve important and recurrent problems that arise economy, ecology and further applied areas. Nadja is co-author of the R package `bamlss` and the C++ library `BayesX`.

		[__Nikolaus Umlauf__](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~umlauf/) Assistant Professor in Statistics, Universität Innsbruck (Austria). His research focuses on complex (Bayesian) distributional regression models that can combine
	    commonly used approaches for modeling highly nonlinear data with methods used in machine learning. The applications of this modeling framework are diverse,
	    from economic problems to meteorological, medical and remote sensing, etc. He is co-author of the R package `bamlss`, the C++ library `BayesX` and its corresponding
	    R interface package `R2BayesX`, as well as the the R package `exams`.

	- Audience

	    Statisticians and applied researchers with strong interest in quantitative analysis

   -   Abstract

        This course is aimed to statisticians and applied
        researchers who are interested in learning about various
        types of Additive Regression using the R packages
        BayesX (http://www.BayesX.org) and
        bamlss (https://cran.r-project.org/package=bamlss). Additive
        regression, i.e., penalised spline smoothing and structured
        additive distributional regression models provide a simple
        yet flexible possibility to introduce nonlinear covariate
        effects in any type of regression models. In a Bayesian
        formulation, the penalty terms transform into specific prior
        distributions that enforce appropriate smoothness of
        the estimates. The short course will focus on fundamental
        construction principles of structured additive regression
        models under Bayesian perspective.

        Usual exponential family regression models solely focus on
        modelling the conditional mean of a response distribution
        dependent on a set of covariates. While this entails easy
        interpretation, the basic assumption that higher order
        moments of the conditional distribution are constant for all
        observations might be too restrictive in complex data
        structures and thus lead to false conclusions drawn from
        the models. Distributional regression combines the
        flexibility in terms of structured additive predictors
        developed for mean regression models with an increased
        flexibility in terms of the parametric response distribution
        that can be assumed. Examples for the latter are
        zero-inflated count data models, location-scale models or
        models for multivariate, correlated responses. After
        reviewing concepts of penalised spline smoothing and
        geoadditive regression, this course treats distributional
        regression for different types of univariate responses as
        well as multivariate responses. Variable selection and model
        choice strategies will be addressed.

        The course will cover models in different fields of
        statistics along real data examples to illustrate the
        potentials of these models. The statistical software used in
        the course will be R. The main packages will be BayesX
        and bamlss. Copies of the training materials will be
        provided as well as data examples with code. Important
        Bayesian tools like hyperprior choices or convergence
        diagnosis for Bayesian inference will be introduced as well.
        Lecture sessions will be followed by hands-on practical
        sessions, where attendants will be able to fit different
        models in practice using the two R-packages.
