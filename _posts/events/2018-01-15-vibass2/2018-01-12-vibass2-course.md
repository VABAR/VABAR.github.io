    [__Nadja Klein__](https://mbs.edu/faculty/nadja-klein), Feodor-Lynen-Fellow (Humboldt Foundation), University of Melbourne (Australia). Nadja pursued research in the areas of Bayesian statistics, computational methods, machine learning with a focus on developing distributional statistical and econometric methods for large and complex datasets. These can be used for modelling highly nonlinear data and to solve important and recurrent problems that arise economy, ecology and further applied areas. Nadja is co-author of the R package `bamlss` and the C++ library `BayesX`.

    [__Nikolaus Umlauf__](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~umlauf/) Assistant Professor in Statistics, Universität Innsbruck (Austria). His research focuses on complex (Bayesian) distributional regression models that can combine
    commonly used approaches for modeling highly nonlinear data with methods used in machine learning. The applications of this modeling framework are diverse,
    from economic problems to meteorological, medical and remote sensing, etc. He is co-author of the R package `bamlss`, the C++ library `BayesX` and its corresponding
    R interface package `R2BayesX`, as well as the the R package `exams`.

    Statisticians and applied researchers with strong interest in quantitative analysis

-   Abstract

    This course is aimed to statisticians and applied
    researchers who are interested in learning about various
    types of Additive Regression using the R packages
    BayesX (http://www.BayesX.org) and
    bamlss (https://cran.r-project.org/package=bamlss). Additive
    regression, i.e., penalised spline smoothing and structured
    additive distributional regression models provide a simple
    yet flexible possibility to introduce nonlinear covariate
    effects in any type of regression models. In a Bayesian
    formulation, the penalty terms transform into specific prior
    distributions that enforce appropriate smoothness of
    the estimates. The short course will focus on fundamental
    construction principles of structured additive regression
    models under Bayesian perspective.

    Usual exponential family regression models solely focus on
    modelling the conditional mean of a response distribution
    dependent on a set of covariates. While this entails easy
    interpretation, the basic assumption that higher order
    moments of the conditional distribution are constant for all
    observations might be too restrictive in complex data
    structures and thus lead to false conclusions drawn from
    the models. Distributional regression combines the
    flexibility in terms of structured additive predictors
    developed for mean regression models with an increased
    flexibility in terms of the parametric response distribution
    that can be assumed. Examples for the latter are
    zero-inflated count data models, location-scale models or
    models for multivariate, correlated responses. After
    reviewing concepts of penalised spline smoothing and
    geoadditive regression, this course treats distributional
    regression for different types of univariate responses as
    well as multivariate responses. Variable selection and model
    choice strategies will be addressed.

    The course will cover models in different fields of
    statistics along real data examples to illustrate the
    potentials of these models. The statistical software used in
    the course will be R. The main packages will be BayesX
    and bamlss. Copies of the training materials will be
    provided as well as data examples with code. Important
    Bayesian tools like hyperprior choices or convergence
    diagnosis for Bayesian inference will be introduced as well.
    Lecture sessions will be followed by hands-on practical
    sessions, where attendants will be able to fit different
    models in practice using the two R-packages.
