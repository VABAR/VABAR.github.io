VIBASS3 is the third edition of the summer school on Bayesian
Statistics to be held from 22 to 26 July 2019 in València
(Spain). 

The five days of VIBASS are organised in __three parts__:

1. The first two days include a __basic course on Bayesian learning__ (12 hours), with conceptual sessions in the morning and practical sessions with R packages in the afternoon.

	It would be advisable that participants bring their laptops for the practical sessions.

2. The [second part]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass3-course/) is dedicated to an __issue of current interest in Bayesian research__. 

	This edition is dedicated to __Applied Bayesian Computation__ and the [`NIMBLE`](https://r-nimble.org/) Platform for Hierarchical Modeling and MCMC.

	This [12 h course]({{ site.url }}/events/vibass3-course/) is provided by [__Daniel Turek__](https://danielturek.weebly.com), Assistant Professor of Statistics, Williams College and member of the [`NIMBLE`](https://r-nimble.org/) Development Team.
