VIBASS I is the first edition of the summer school on Bayesian Statistics to be held from 17th until 21st July 2017 in València (Spain).
VIBASS offers an opportunity to be introduced into the Bayesian reasoning without
previous knowledge in the subject.

The five days of VIBASS are organised in __three parts__:

1. The first two days include a __basic course on Bayesian learning__ (12 hours), with conceptual sessions in the morning and practical sessions in basic Bayesian R packages in the afternoon.
It would be advisable that participants bring their laptops for the practical sessions.

2. The second part is dedicated to an __issue of current interest in Bayesian research__. This first edition is dedicated to __Stan__, a probabilistic programming language for describing data and models for Bayesian inference.
This course (12 hours) is provided by [__Aki Vehtari__](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/), Associate professor in computational science at Aalto University (Helsinky), co-author of the third edition of the book Bayesian Data Analysis and member of the Stan development team.

3. The last day, Friday 21th, is devoted to the __First VIBASS Workshop__.
It includes two __plenary sessions__, with invited speakers researchers [__Mark Brewer__](http://www.bioss.ac.uk/people/markb.html) from Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) and [__Maria Grazia Pennino__](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Pennino) (Instituto Oceanográfico de Murcia), and a wide __poster session__ with contributions of the participants in the school.

We are also preparing an __exciting social programe__ for the Summer School.

## Schedule

- Monday 17th and Tuesday 18th: _Introduction to Bayesian Learning_.

  Instructors: Carmen Armero, David Conesa, Anabel Forte and Virgilio Gómez-Rubio.

- Wednesday 19th and Thursday 20th: _Bayesian modeling with Stan, predictive model assessment and comparison, and variable selection in large p, small n case_.

  The first day covers Stan probabilistic programming software, writing
  models in Stan language, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No-U-Turn-sampling methods
  for inference, and necessary diagnostics for checking the inference. The second
  day covers methods for assessing predictive performance and making model
  comparison, and ends up with more detailed discussion of variable selection in
  large p, small n case.

  Instructor: [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) (Aalto University, Finland).

- Friday 21th: _First VIBASS Workshop_.

  Invited speakers:

    - [Mark Brewer](http://www.bioss.ac.uk/people/markb.html), Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS), UK

    - [Maria Grazia Pennino](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Pennino), Instituto Oceanográfico de Murcia, Spain
