- Abstract

Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) facilitates the
fitting of a large range of complex hierarchical statistical
models, by dramatically reducing computation time. During two days
at VIBASS4, we aim to give an introduction to the general
methodology and the R-INLA package. We will start with a general
overview of the possibilities of INLA for applied research and for
model development, and it proceeds with examples of generalised
linear models with several random effects. We will discuss the
innovative ideas making INLA fast; why most likelihoods are
near-Gaussian in the posterior, how to represent random effects
with sparse matrices, and more.

The main part of these lectures will be practically oriented.
Using examples we will explain how to fit different models in
practice using R-INLA, and how to interpret the results. The
models we fit include, for example, Gaussian, Binomial and Poisson
likelihoods, auto-regressive, random walk, varying-intercept
models, models for survival data and joint survival-longitudinal
models. We will discuss the choice of priors, and how to compare
models.

We will also present what we have not discussed, but could have
done, like spatial (geographical) modelling and how to construct
spatial models with the stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) approach, and its use in point process models like
log-Gaussian Cox processes. In ecology, these models result in
habitat maps and abundance maps, and in disease mapping they
result in continuous risk maps and in risk classification maps.

For a background on R-INLA, one of the books listed at
[www.r-inla.org/books](www.r-inla.org/books)
can be consulted, as well as the two
recent published review papers, which arxiv versions are
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06350](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06350)
and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00860](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00860).
