## Variable selection with missing data for biomedicine

Variable selection is a common practice in biomedical research,
particularly in determining the predictive factors of a clinical condition.
In addition, missing data are also common in this context. We address the
interplay between these two problems, which are frequently encountered in
biostatistics but surprisingly have received little attention in the
literature. An example is used to demonstrate the problem, in which we
apply an objective Bayesian variable selection procedure that naturally
incorporates multiple imputation. This methodology utilizes all available
data, requires no user specifications, employs available R packages, and
produces interpretable results.
