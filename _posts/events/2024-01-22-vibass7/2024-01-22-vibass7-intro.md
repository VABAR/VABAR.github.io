The first two days include a basic course on Bayesian learning (12 hours), alternating conceptual and practical hands-on sessions.
This is a summary of the contents of both days.

We use the R package [`vibass`](http://vabar.es/vibass/) which contains the practical activities and a few interactive apps.
Please make sure that you bring a recent R version, with recently updated packages.
Follow the instructions on the package website for installing it, ideally prior to the workshop, to make the most of our time together.
