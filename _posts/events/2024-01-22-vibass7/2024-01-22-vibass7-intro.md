The first two days include a basic course on Bayesian learning (12 hours), with conceptual sessions in the morning and practical sessions with basic Bayesian packages in the afternoon. 
This is a summary of the contents of both days.

We use the R package [`vibass`](http://vabar.es/vibass/) which contains the practical activities and a few interactive apps.
Please make sure that you bring a recent R version, with recently updated packages.
Follow the instructions on the package website for installing it, ideally prior to the workshop, to make the most of our time together.

## Monday

### Session I: __All you need is... probability__

Frequentist and Bayesian probability. Bayesâ€™ theorem for random events and variables,
parameters, hypothesis, etc. Sequential updating. Predictive probabilities.

### Session II: __Binary data__

__Proportions__: binomial distribution and likelihood function.
__Prior distribution__: the beta distribution.
__Summarising__ posterior inferences.


### Session III. __Inference and prediction with simulated samples__

__Estimation and prediction__. Simulated samples: comparison of independent populations.

### Session IV. __Count data__

__Count data__: Poisson distribution. Poisson model parameterised in terms of rate and exposure. Gamma distribution as __conjugate prior distributions__. Negative binomial __predictive distributions__. 


### Session V. Normal data.

__Normal data__: Estimation of a normal mean with known variance. __Prediction__ of a future observation. Normal data with unknown mean and variance. __Nuisance
parameters__. __Joint prior distributions__. Joint, conditional and marginal
__posterior distributions__. 


## Tuesday

### Session I: Numerical approaches.

The big problem in the Bayesian framework: resolution of integrals that appear when applying the learning process.
Gaussian approximations, Laplace approximations, Monte Carlo integration and importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo.


### Session II. Bayesian linear models.

Apply basic Importance Sampling and MCMC methods via available software for fitting regression models.

### Session III. Bayesian generalised linear models.

Extending regression models to non-Gaussian responses.

### Session IV. Bayesian hierarchical models.

Incorporating _random_ effects: __Bayesian hierarchical models__ (BHMs), the coolest tool for modelling highly structured models. Hierarchies, hyperparameters, and hyperpriors. (Generalised) linear mixed models as basic examples of BHMs.
__Software__ for inference in Bayesian hierarchical models.
