The València International Bayesian Analysis Summer School endorses the [initiative #WhereIsShe](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/spain/es/parlamento_europeo.html), which is promoted by the Delegation of the European Parliament in Spain and supported by ADEIT, the technical secretariat of the conference.  Our support for this initiative is part of a commitment to classify participation of expert panellists in each of the VIBASS sessions according to gender, in order to identify the percentage of female participants in the programme during the course.

The project #WhereIsShe falls to a large extent within the political and legislative strategy of the European Union, the main aim of which is to reach gender equality through gender perspective inclusion for all community policies and communications of the European Parliament.
