BioSS and VaBaR are keen to organise short reciprocal exchange visits for their PhD students and post-docs.
If you are interested in making an exchange visit, you can apply via the following procedure.



1. Discuss the timing and topic with your own supervisor(s) or manager(s).

1. Study the interests of the partner organisation you wish to visit (see research areas at [VaBaR]({{ site.url }}/research) and [BioSS](http://www.bioss.ac.uk/research.html)) to identify whether the topic is of relevance to them.

1. Write a short proposal (about 300 words) describing the project you wish to work on during the visit. The proposal should explain how the exchange visit will be beneficial to you.

1. Email the proposal, together with a CV and suggesting dates for your visit, to (a) if you wish to visit VaBaR from BioSS: Carmen Armero (Carmen [dot] Armero [at] uv [dot] es), or (b) if you wish to visit BioSS from VaBaR: Mark Brewer (Mark [dot] Brewer [at] bioss [dot] ac [dot] uk).

You can also email Carmen or Mark if you have any questions about the above procedure, for example if you are having difficulty at stage 2 above.
